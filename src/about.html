            <p>Founded in 2020 by adventure‑driven duo <strong>Maya Alvarez</strong> and <strong>Luca Bianchi</strong>, Van Travel began as a shared notebook of road‑trip ideas that quickly turned into a reality on four wheels. Maya, a former graphic designer from Barcelona, fell in love with the freedom of nomadic living after a solo week‑long trek through the Pyrenees, where she discovered that a well‑designed, compact space could become a moving canvas for creativity and comfort. Luca, an ex‑mechanic and sustainability engineer from Milan, spent his early career fine‑tuning high‑performance engines before realizing his true passion lay in building eco‑friendly mobile homes that minimize environmental impact. Together they combined Maya’s eye for aesthetic, seamless interiors with Luca’s technical expertise, converting a vintage Sprinter into the prototype that would launch Van Travel’s first curated fleet of fully equipped, solar‑powered vans.</p>
